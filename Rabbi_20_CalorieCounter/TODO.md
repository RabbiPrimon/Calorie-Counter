# TODO List for Fixing Text Color in Add Consumption Form

- [ ] Edit `templates/add_consumption.html` to add `text-primary` class to the labels for "Food Item", "Calories", and "Quantity"
- [ ] Verify that the labels appear in blue color after the changes
- [ ] Test the form functionality to ensure it still works correctly
